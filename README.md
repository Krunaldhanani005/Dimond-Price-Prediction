# Dimond-Price-Prediction
Diamonds are one of the most valuable and sought-after gemstones, and their prices vary significantly based on multiple attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity, and dimensions. Traditionally, pricing has relied on expert judgment and market trends, which can be subjective and inconsistent.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the price of a diamond using a structured dataset. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the data, the model can provide accurate and objective price estimates. The project uses tools such as Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, with Random Forest Regressor selected as the final predictive model due to its high accuracy and robustness.

This approach not only improves pricing transparency but also offers a practical solution for the diamond industry to automate valuation and support data-driven decisions.
